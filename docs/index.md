The models are trained on a combination of UN-provided survey data and open-source remote sensing data. Open-source data from Google Earth Engine is collected via the [airPy]([https://pages.github.com/](https://github.com/kelsdoerksen/airPy/tree/master)https://github.com/kelsdoerksen/airPy/tree/master).
